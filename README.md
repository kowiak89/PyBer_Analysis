# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data based on city type.  We conducted our analysis on three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  We focused on the number of rides, number of drivers, and fare amounts in each city type.  Our data was sourced from city_data.csv and ride_data.csv.

## Results
In our preliminary analysis, we analyzed the differences in ride count, driver, count, and average fare amount (in $USD) for each city type.  From the pyber_summary_df we can see that the Urban city type had the most rides, drivers, and total fares.  Also, the rural city type had the highest avg fare cost and highest avg fare per driver.  Drivers in rural cities made over 3 times as much per ride as drivers in urban cities did!

In our analysis we also looked at the total weekly fare by city type as seen in the [Total Fare by City Type](https://github.com/kowiak89/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pyber_Fare_Summary.png) image.  From this graph we can see that the urban city type generated more fare money per week than both of the other city types.  The suburban city type was the next highest weekly earner, and the rural city type was the lowest weekly earner.  We can also wee that the total weekly fares was steady throughout the selected time period, indicating that the number of rides remained consistent across the time period.

## Recommendations
Our analysis has shown that there are many disparities between the city types.  To close these disparties, we have come up with several solutions.  One disparity is the lack of drivers in the rural city type.  This lack of drivers might result in there being less rides availalbe to the residents.  If we can increase the number of drivers then we can increase the availibity of rides.

Another recommendation would be to increase the avg fare for drivers in the urban city type.  From the analysis urban drivers make significantly less than drivers in other city types.  Therefore, they need to complete more rides to make the same amount of money.  By shifting the amount of money going to the drivers we can help to close that gap.

A third recommendation is to increase the number of rides in the rural and suburban city types.  These city types have significantly fewer trips compared to the urban city type.  There are likely multiple reasons for fewer rides in these areas such as decreased driver availability and increased ride cost.  By addressing these two issues we can increase the number of rides the residents in these city types take.
