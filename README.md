# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data based on city type.  We conducted our analysis on three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  We focused on the number of rides, number of drivers, and fare amounts in each city type.  Our data was sourced from city_data.csv and ride_data.csv.

## Results
In our preliminary analysis, we analyzed the differences in ride count, driver, count, and average fare amount (in $USD) for each city type.  From the pyber_summary_df we can see that the Urban city type had the most rides, drivers, and total fares.  Also, the rural city type had the highest avg fare cost and highest avg fare per driver.  Drivers in rural cities made over 3 times as much per ride as drivers in urban cities did!

In our analysis we also looked at the total weekly fare by city type as seen in the [Total Fare by City Type](https://github.com/kowiak89/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pyber_Fare_Summary.png) image.
